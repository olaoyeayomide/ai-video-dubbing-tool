# Voice Management Enhancement - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 7 of the Real-Time AI Dubbing Project, focusing on Voice Management Enhancement. This phase will build on the existing backend and browser extension to implement advanced speaker identification, voice cloning, and voice library management.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Advanced Speaker Identification

#### Technologies
- **WSI (Whisper Speaker Identification) Framework**: For cross-lingual speaker identification
- **Speaker Embeddings**: 256-dimensional embeddings for unique speaker profiles

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Integrate WSI framework into backend
- [ ] Implement real-time speaker detection and tracking
- [ ] Create speaker profile database for persistent identification
- [ ] Develop speaker change detection algorithm

### 2. Voice Cloning Enhancement

#### Technologies
- **ElevenLabs Professional Voice Clones API**: For high-quality voice cloning
- **Voice Quality Analysis**: Tools for evaluating voice clone accuracy

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance ElevenLabs API integration for professional voice clones
- [ ] Implement voice similarity scoring
- [ ] Create automatic voice quality optimization
- [ ] Develop voice style transfer capabilities

### 3. Actor Voice Preservation System

#### Technologies
- **Local Storage**: For caching voice models
- **Speaker-to-Voice Mapping**: Database for consistent voice assignment

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create persistent speaker-to-voice mapping system
- [ ] Implement voice model caching for improved performance
- [ ] Develop voice consistency validation metrics
- [ ] Build voice preservation logic across content

### 4. Voice Library Management Interface

#### Technologies
- **Web UI**: For voice management
- **WebSocket API**: For real-time voice updates

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design voice library management UI
- [ ] Implement voice sample upload and processing
- [ ] Create voice testing and preview functionality
- [ ] Develop voice sorting and tagging system

4. Develop real-time speaker tracking

### Phase 7.2: Voice Cloning and Quality
1. Enhance ElevenLabs API integration
2. Implement voice quality metrics
3. Create voice optimization algorithms
4. Develop voice style transfer capabilities

### Phase 7.3: Voice Preservation System
1. Create speaker-to-voice mapping database
2. Implement voice model caching
3. Develop voice consistency validation
4. Build cross-content voice preservation

### Phase 7.4: Management Interface
1. Design voice library UI components
2. Implement voice sample processing
3. Create voice testing functionality
4. Develop comprehensive management system

## Success Criteria
- Speaker identification accuracy >95%
- Voice similarity score >90%
- Voice preservation consistency across content >98%
